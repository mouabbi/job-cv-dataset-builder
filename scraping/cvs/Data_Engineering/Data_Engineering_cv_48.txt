company - Tata Consultancy Services
description - Project Details
Client/Project: Barclays UK London/HEXAD
Environment: Informatica (Power Center), SQL Server, UNIX, Autosys, Intellimatch.

Project Description:
The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds.

These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer. The reconciliation tool is
designed to source data from an ETL layer. The data from the Front and Back office systems,
together with static data must therefore be delivered to ETL. Here it will be pre-processed and delivered to reconciliation tool before the reconciliation process can be performed.

Role and Responsibilities:
â¢ Responsible for analyzing, designing and developing ETL strategies and processes,
writing ETL specifications
â¢ Requirement gathering
â¢ Making functional documents and low level documents
â¢ Developing and debugging the Informatica mappings to resolve bugs, and identify the causes of failures
â¢ User interaction to identify the issues with the data loaded through the application
â¢ Developed mappings using different transformations
